# vMalConv Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the vMalConv project, which focuses on malware detection using the MalConv architecture in PyTorch. The project utilizes the Ember 2018 dataset for training and evaluation.

## File Structure
The file structure of this project is organized as follows:
- `vMalConv.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for training the MalConv model, evaluating its performance, and saving the trained model.
- `malware_detection_app.py`: Python script containing the Streamlit web application for deploying the trained model as a cloud API.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.
- `trained_model.pth`: Pre-trained model weights saved after training the MalConv model.
- Other supporting files and datasets used in the project.

## Instructions
To run the code and deploy the model as a cloud API, follow these steps:

1. Open the `vMalConv.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or any compatible environment.
2. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to download the dataset, train the MalConv model, evaluate its performance, and save the trained model.
3. After training the model, the notebook will save the trained model weights to `trained_model.pth`.
4. Use the `malware_detection_app.py` script to deploy the model as a Streamlit web application. Make sure to have Streamlit installed (`pip install streamlit`).
5. Run the Streamlit app using the command `streamlit run malware_detection_app.py`.
6. Access the web application via the provided URL and upload PE files to classify them as malware or benign.
